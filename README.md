# RC-Mixup: A Data Augmentation Strategy against Noisy Data for Regression Tasks
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper accepted at KDD 2024.
# Abstract
This work presents RC-Mixup, a novel data augmentation technique specifically designed to improve regression model performance in the presence of noisy data. Our method combines robust regression principles with mixup augmentation to create synthetic training samples that enhance model generalization.
